IMPORTANT:
!! Don't replace sequencepool, instead just add a new variable sequencepool2 !!

In the sesscreen class, I need you to update a couple methods to do the following:

When you click on the buttons of the sequencer screen, the corresponding notes are added to a variable, sequencepool

right now when the button is clicked a list is added to sequencepool containing basic infos:
[Step number,Note number, Note length]

I need you to change it so the data like this:
[Step number,Note number, Note on]
[Step number,Note number, Note off]

The step number of the note off list should be greater than the one from note on

______

the way midi messages work is, there are note on messages (so the note is pressed on a keyboard for example) and note off messages (note released)

because I will need to send these messages outside of my app (this is why it is called a sequencer), I need the sequencepool format to be compatible

______

the first thing is just to update the sequencepool format, so just the monitor function

it is not hat simple because there is also the zoom to take into acount

that*

if you zoom then the note duration of keys pressed changes

_____

so it is linked to the zoom

do you understand what the steps are ?

when zoom = 1 each button represent one step

for zoom 4 (basic view) each button is 4 steps

so if you clic on a button it will update sequencepool with a new list, [step number, note number, note on] then add an other [step number + 4, note number, note off]

you need to add something like:
sequencepool2[trackselected-1].append([(x-1)*zoom+rangeX+1,y+rangeY-1,"note on"])
sequencepool2[trackselected-1].append([(x-1)*zoom+rangeX+1+zoom,y+rangeY-1,"note off"])

every time there is a note on, then, a couple steps after (based on the zoom) there is a note off

when you remove the note, then it removes both note on and note off

here are a couple examples:
step number : 10
note: 40
zoom 1
then [10,40,note on][11,40,note on]
step number : 25
note: 40
zoom 2
then [25,40,note on][27,40,note on]

I mean
step number : 10
note: 40
zoom 1
then [10,40,note on][11,40,note off]
step number : 25
note: 40
zoom 2
then [25,40,note on][27,40,note off]

the zoom actually defines the size of the button (size as number of steps)
